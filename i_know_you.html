        <p class="qst_p">Nipun has maybe seen the responses. At that moment, I think only Alefiya and Sid had filled up the form. Sid saw some responses too. So we have two options: <br><br>1. Let it slide. Take the chance that they've forgot the details, which is quiet unlikely. <br>2. We prohibit Nipun, Alefiya and Sid to make a group among themselves. <br><br>Now about making groups, a person gets to choose one and one only. Its certain that some people will be selected by more than one player. This is a problem. So the current (temp) solution is to remove the person who is once chosen. The one who goes first gets 7 options, the next gets 5, then 3 and so on. The one who goes first will be decided on luck, sadly. If you have a better plan, we'll do that. <br><br>Now regarding the questions to be asked, we have the responses with us. The questions are as follows, (can be jumbled up or just asked in the order given. Currently they are arranged in increasing order of relative difficulty.)

        <p class="qst_p">1. What annoys $ the most? <br>2. What makes $ feel super good? <br>3. Would $ redo thier college life? <br>4. Who is $'s travel buddy? <br>5. $'s fav place to eat inside college <br>6. $'s fav place to eat in bhopal. <br>7. $'s fav food <br>8. And so on further. Its too much to write. :'( <br><br> The main thing to see is if we should or should not give options. The game gets hardcore tough without it. <br><br> </p>
