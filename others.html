      <p class="qst_p">1. Alphaget <br><br> We tell them an alphabet and they’ll have to bring stuff whose name starts with that letter.
        Things which have been given names by them won’t be considered (like a plant they call chintu
        for letter c). Only things which are named publicly. <br><br>
        Everyone gets the same letter or we decide with Math.rand() from a set of alphabets which have
        easier availibilty (i.e. removing z,q,x, etc).
        <br>
        The one who gets all the fastest shall win.<br><br>
        If draw, then tougher alphabets in a lower time limit.
        <br><br>
        2. Title-Monger <br><br>
        The final years will vote on titles we announce. One senior gets one title. Once they get a title,
        they’ll be out of the race to get another but still can vote. If in the case another title comes up
        which better suits an already title winner, the previously awarded title can be withdrawn and it
        will be up for grabs again. <br><br>
        Exemplar titles:
        The Expert, The Party monster, etc <br><br>
        Titles havent been decided.
        <br><br>
        3. Game Hosts: Pushpita and Smruthi <br><br>
        4. Heavy lines:<br>
        No prize. Individual.<br>
        Host: Pushpita <br>
        Each senior will have to define the other senior allotted to them in a sentence. This gives us 8X7
        pairs. They can also say something which they always wanted to say but never could, like
        thanking them, etc etc. If there is a constraint on time, we can stick to the “one sentence only”
        rule thoroughly.<br><br>
        This one is a bit long. So won’t be conducted all at once. At any random moment, the host will
        announce two or three pair, i.e., the person’s name who shall be saying and the person about
        whom they have to speak.<br><br>
