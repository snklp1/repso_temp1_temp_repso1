        <p class="qst_p">In 30 seconds, the one who transfers the most balls from one bowl to another shall win. We make them sit a bit back so that we can invigilate properly. We assign each senior with one third
year who will check only on that senior.
If Draw, then cycle shall be repeated with lower time (20 seconds, 10 seconds, etc) <br> <br> Here we will assign one member to one senior and he will pin the screen of that senior to his/her screen and will then solely invigilate that person. <br><br>1. Ashutosh = Nikita <br>2. Sid = Dipanshu <br>3. Sakshi = Shantanu <br>4. Nashit = Raktim <br>5. Alefiya = Jyoti <br>6. Ritesh = Medhaa <br>7. Shrikaran = Adviti <br>8. Nipun = Deepansh <br><br> We wont tell them exactly who is monitoring who, but I don't know what this will accomplish. <br><br>Making this list here so that everyone remembers this. :) </p>
